Welcome to ysh (yuri's shell)!

I hope you enjoy your use of it (at your own risk)!

Here are some basics to learn how to use the shell:

There are two modes, interactive and batch mode.

Interactive mode is used by running the shell program with no parameters, causing commands to be read in from the user's typing.

Batch mode is activated when the shell is ran and the first argument is a file that contains a list of commands to be ran consecutively.

Here are some basic functions of the shell:

help - displays shell's usage
dir <dirname> - display the contents of a dir
environ - displays all environment variables
pause - pauses execution of the shell until enter is pressed
quit - quits the shell and all of its child processes
echo - echoes all of its arguments
clr - clears the screen
cd - changes directory

the & operator can be used to run commands in background
the | operator can be used to redirect the output of command into the input of other commands
the < operator reads input from a file
the > operator outputs command output to a file
the >> operator appends output instead

you can run any binary found in the directories of the PATH variable or any binary by its full location

Enjoy!
